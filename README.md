# [Open at RIT](http://open-at-rit.herokuapp.com) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thenickperson/open-at-rit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thenickperson/open-at-rit) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/thenickperson/open-at-rit.png)](https://gemnasium.com/thenickperson/open-at-rit) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thenickperson/open-at-rit.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thenickperson/open-at-rit)

## Status: unstable and in development
Please do not rely on it yet, as locations are currently always displayed as
closed (which is innacurate). This should be fixed soon.

## About
Open at RIT is a simple one-page web application that makes it easy to check
which dining locations are currently open at the [Rochester Institute of
Technology](https://www.rit.edu).

## Definite Features (in development)
- a simple, color-coded display that makes it easy to see what's open
- a responsive design that also works well on smartphones
- information on the hours for different locations
- support for special hours (hours for time periods where students do not often
  take classes, such as breaks and summer quarters/semesters)

## Possible Features
- sorting locations based on name, open/closed status, hours, etc.
- filtering locations based on tags
- support for other kinds of locations (like offices, labs, and stores)
- a scraper that automatically updates the app's database with information from
  RIT's website
- a simple JSON API
